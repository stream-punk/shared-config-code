shared-config
=============

some of my config that might help someone else.

markwarp
--------

Kakoune and kak-lsp support markup in hover messages, but at the time of
writing kak-lsp cannot wordwrap the hover info. Since there is markup in info
`fmt` doesn't wrap it correctly. This is the solution.

escape.kak
----------

make <A-j> a system-wide replacement for escape.
